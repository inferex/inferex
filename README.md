## CLI - Basic usage

1. Create or navigate to the project folder you wish to deploy. You may copy an
   example project folder from the examples folder ("face_detection",
   "sentiment_analysis", etc). Each example has inferex.yaml, pipeline.py, and
   requirements.txt files.

1. Run the "inferex login" command to log in with your inferex account
   and save your token locally.

1. Run "inferex deploy". This will create a tar archive of your project folder
   and send it to the server for processing.

That's it! `inferex deployments` will list your deployed projects and their URLs.
